# AI-Driven Face Analysis System

## Overview

The **AI-Driven Face Analysis System** is a comprehensive, real-time platform that integrates multiple advanced AI features into one solution. It is designed to analyze facial data and provide functionalities such as:

* Emotion detection with real-time suggestions
* Liveness detection to prevent fake images
* Health monitoring using facial features
* Smart attendance recognition
* Face shape classification with personalized style recommendations
* Age and gender prediction

This system is suitable for applications in healthcare, security, education, and corporate environments, enhancing emotional well-being, health tracking, and secure user identification.

## Features

1. **Emotion Detection:** Detects happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, and neutral emotions. Provides personalized suggestions or motivational quotes.
2. **Liveness Detection:** Verifies real human faces and prevents spoofing with AI-generated or fake images.
3. **Health Monitoring:** Analyzes facial signs like skin tone, eye condition, and stress indicators to provide basic health insights.
4. **Smart Attendance Tracking:** Automatically logs attendance by recognizing registered users in real-time.
5. **Face Shape Classification:** Identifies face shapes (oval, square, round, heart, pear, etc.) and gives style recommendations for hair, glasses, and beard.
6. **Age & Gender Prediction:** Estimates a person’s age and gender accurately using deep learning models.
